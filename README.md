Bet randomizes closeby restaurants, bars, shop, event, and present them as cards for users to swipe on. Also, Bet is a fun game where users can challenge their friends to complete tasks. 

By using Goolge and Yelp APIs, Bet randomizes restaurant/bar/shop/event near the users and allows the users to swipe on the choices. The application gives groups of friends who cannot decide what to do or where to go an opportunity of spontaneous trips. 

Bet also has an interactive challenge mode which allows one user to send a link to another user to generate tasks to complete. The tasks are meant to be hilarious and funny.

Note: The application was created in a day for a hackathon. Currently, only the mobile version is available. We are aware of the issues of responsive design and of usability. We intend to polish the application at upcoming hackathons.
